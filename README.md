# Max's Word Guess Game

This is a game I made to help me learn some of the basics of Javascript.

## Gameplay
The object of the game is a hangman style game where the user tries to guess a random word that the computer has selected. The word is related to the American TV show, The Office. The user wins when they guess the word correctly. The game resets when the user has guessed the correct word or run out of guesses.
